# Oerview

This repository contains the implementation of a spam email detection model using various machine learning algorithms.

# Algorithms Used:

•	Logistic Regression

•	Random Forest Classifier

•	AdaBoost Classifier

•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


# Description

The goal of this project is to build a model that can effectively classify emails as either spam or not spam based on their content features. This is achieved by training and evaluating the performance of 

multiple machine learning algorithms listed above.
